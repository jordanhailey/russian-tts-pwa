# A Russian Text-To-Speech App

## Roadmap
- [ ] 🗣️ Working text to speech translation 
- [ ] 💅 Make it beautiful 
- [ ] 🤖 Enable offline usage (make it a PWA)
- [ ] ⏯️ Better control over starting / stopping TTS
- [ ] ***e/ë*** (??) Stress Marking (I still need help understanding proper intonation to figure this one out) 
- [ ] 👂 (??) Rooglish (depends on stress marking)
- [ ] 🌐 (??) Tranlation (depending on what OSS libraries are available, or I may try using serverless functions to solve for this)

## Developing
Once you've cloned this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
